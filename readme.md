Introduction

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'd like to introduce you to a project I've been working on as part of my learning journey and personal development in software development. While exploring and enhancing my coding skills, I took inspiration from the remarkable open-source project, Copier.

About the Project

Copier is a C# open-source project that originally aimed to tackle a significant challenge in software development â€“ reducing compilation times for large projects. It provides a clever and efficient way to manage file and directory copying, contributing to faster compilation processes.

My Journey

In my pursuit of software development excellence, I embarked on the journey of re-implementing Copier from scratch using C#. My goal was to delve deeper into software development principles, gain practical experience with C#, and refine my coding skills. This project has been instrumental in my quest for continuous learning and improvement.

Why You Should Check It Out

If you're interested in C# programming, software architecture, or keen on exploring how an open-source project like Copier can significantly impact the compilation times of substantial projects, I encourage you to explore my implementation. While it may not match the feature set or maturity of the original project, it stands as evidence of my commitment to continuous growth and development.
